# Go - REST Service Starter Kit
This is a simple boilerplate & template starter for creating a REST based HTTP microservice / server in Go.

It uses as few external libraries as possible but provides a minimal getting started baseline.

Included features:

- Helper for loading config from environmental variables
- Standard code for serving static content or a SPA
- Loads config from .env (dotenv) files as required
- Gorilla mux for HTTP routing
- Simple logging and CORS middleware 
- Health and status routes
- Placeholders for versioning and build details
- A standard Dockerfile

This has been developed in Go 1.12, uses modules and follows the https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout guidelines for project structure
